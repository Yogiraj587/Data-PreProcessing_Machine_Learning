# Data-Preprocessor for Machine Learning
Submission for Octahacks 4.0 by Team : 404 ErrOr Resolved

## MACHINE LEARNING IS EVERYWHERE  !!!
At this point in world where Technology is irresistible, it is a fact that ML is everywhere around us. From feeds that we see on the timeline to notifications that we receive from the social media apps, everything is curated by ML.
The recommended video list on youtube, recommended shows on Netflix or pre-created playlist on Spotify or any other media or music streaming service are all done by ML programs. 
Smart search engines that can optimize our search with a keyword search or respond to human speech (Siri, Cortana, and Google Now) are also an outcome of ML algorithms. We see ML in healthcare for faster patient diagnosis .We have Fully automatic driverless cars out of ML.
Amazon- They got to be the world leaders in inventory management and customer satisfaction index because they brought in Machine Learning in all their systems. The company ships about 1.6 million packages a day all because they have optimized inventory by using trained algorithms.

## DATA IS THE LIFEBLOOD OF ML

Every business has this data in one form or the other but it has to be cleaned and prepared into a state that can be used by Machine Learning to learn from. i.e Data has to be pre processed.
A real-world data generally contains noises, missing values, and maybe in an unusable format which cannot be directly used for machine learning models. Data pre processing is required tasks for cleaning the data and making it suitable for a machine learning model which also increases the accuracy and efficiency of a machine learning model.

Data pre processing is time consuming and we have had the experience. Even during hackathons, most of our time was spend on pre processing the data set to make it fit into machine learning model , Thereby leaving us a very little time to build the actual model.

## PROBLEM STATEMENTS

1.	Real world data is not always in suitable format
2.	Data pre processing is time consuming
3.	Manual data processing are prone to errors
4.	Errors in dataset tests the patience of programmers ultimately resulting in loss of interest and concentration

## PROBLEM SOLUTION 
So, we build a model which can do Machine learning data pre processing. With this model in our hands , ML enthusiast need not waste 7-8 hours to process their data, Every step in pre processing can be done under 30 secs using our model.
Our model can do the following tasks

1. Describing the data based on choice entered by the user
2. Encoding Variable to Number to fit the requirements of Machine Learning Model
3. Scaling of a particular feature in the Dataset (Standardization & Normalization
4. Final Dataset download after modifications
5. Null values/Missing values on dataset are replaced according to users choice
